## 1. Business Context
Adventure Works Cycles, a large, multinational manufacturing company,  produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to North American, European,  and Asian commercial markets. While its base operation is located in Bothell,   Washington, and employs 500 people, several regional sales teams are located throughout the company’s market region. 
After a successful fiscal year, Adventure Works Cycles is looking to broaden its  market share by focusing its sales efforts on the company’s best customers. The sales teams have identified the following requirements that will enable them to perform their jobs better:
* Customer segmentation and profiling:
- What are the early warning signs of problems? 
- Who are the best customers across all product lines? With whom should the sales team focus its efforts for building long-term relationships? 
- What are customers’ issues, categorized according to demographic groups (geographic location, revenue history, and so on)?
- What products are the customers buying and at what rate?
* Sales performance:
- When analyzing the insights of Sales Performance, the manager will comprehend the trend of the performance of each region through time series analysis, and recognize the region as either the potential one or not. Then, they will be supported to make good decisions for business strategies.
